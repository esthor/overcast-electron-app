# overcast-electron-app-mac
A simple (unofficial) overcast.fm podcast app for macOS.

[CLICK HERE FOR MY POST ABOUT THIS APP](https://medium.com/unhype/i-made-a-podcast-app-for-mac-in-less-than-an-hour-695736895a9f)

## Installation (Mac)
1. Just download/clone the 'overcast.app' and open it up

## Reason for this app?
I was tired of having to hunt down a browser window/tab with [overcast.fm](http://overcast.fm) or only listen from iOS. After Instacast went under, Overcast became my preferred podcast app for the last couple of years. The only drawback was there is no native mac app from the company. It was also a nice excuse to wrap a simple webapp for practical daily use. Maybe others can find it useful.

## UI/UX & Design
Please don't blame me for the UI. It's the same as [overcast.fm](http://overcast.fm). If you would like the webapp UI changed, please direct that communication to Overcast: [https://overcast.fm/contact]. If you do see some bugs, and you notice they are probably in my app and not the overcast.fm web site, please let me know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/esthor/overcast-electron-app-mac/issues)

## Linux? Windows?
If there is demand for a Linux or Windows version, please open up an [issue](https://github.com/esthor/overcast-electron-app-mac/issues) and I will get on it. :)

## Shoutouts
Thanks to Jia Hao for making [nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier), an easy CLI for wrapping web apps in electron for native desktop environments.
